## About me

Hello! This is Kaixiang(Kyle-sung) Miao, a master student (expect graduation May, 2018) from [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.upenn.edu) at [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu). I am strongly interested in rendering and game development.

## Present work

* **Reading books**

Real-time rendering technique is an important aspect in game development. I am trying hard to learn knowledge concerning this topic and some tricky skills used to balance the efficiency and the rendering quality seem interesting. Besides, offline rendering is also an interesting topic.

Here are some resources relating to rendering:

*Rendering Grass Terrains in Real-Time with Dynamic Lighting*

*SIGGRAPH 2013 Course: Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice*
[http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/)

I am poring over the following two books:

* **Developing game engine**

I am expanding one of my projects to a small game engine. Besides knowledge concerning computer graphics, Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns relating to software development are also important. The project is based on DirectX11 and Qt.

* **Developing games**

To enhance my ability in game design and practical skills of using game engine, I am developing a 3D Sokoban game using Unity.
