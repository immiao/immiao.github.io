## About me

Hello! This is Miao Kaixiang, an undergraduate student (expect graduation June, 2016) from [School of Data and Computer Science](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn). I have shifted my research focus from artificial intelligence. Now my primary research interest is in computer graphics, game development and programming. See my project page for details.
