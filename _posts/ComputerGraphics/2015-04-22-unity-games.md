## Sokoban

> I am developing another interesting game-***Sokoban***. Players should control the character to push the box to the destination. There're lots of obstacles on the path. So you have to act with wisdom to avoid those traps. It is **different from** the traditional Sokoban game. It is an innovative 3D game, to which elements of RPG(role-playing game) are able to be introduced.
